# Neural Network (NN) Project

## Overview
Welcome to the NN Project, a versatile and comprehensive framework for neural network-based applications, with a particular emphasis on Natural Language Processing (NLP). This repository serves as an umbrella for three key components, each housed in its own submodule, collaboratively offering a robust platform for both general and specialized neural network development and experimentation.

This project is associated with the paper titled "Return of the RNN: Residual Recurrent Networks for Invertible Sentence Embeddings" which provides in-depth explanations of the concepts, methodologies, and findings that underpin this software. The paper can be accessed [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13570v2).
